[Ceredigion Nature Partnership](https://naturceredigion.cymru) has funding for projects to create, restore or enhance natural assets and to deliver nature on your doorstep where people live, work and access public services. The scheme is funded by the Welsh Government’s Local Places for Nature fund.

Projects must:
* Support activities and actions that restore and enhance nature.
* Create 'places for nature’ that can be seen ‘from your doorstep’. This includes where people live, work and access public services. 
* Focus on areas of deprivation, urban and peri-urban areas and those with little access to nature.
* Focus on supporting underrepresented groups and disadvantaged communities.
* Deliver nature and people friendly improvements to a space without any detrimental effects to the native biodiversity already there.
* Encourage community participation and engagement to enable people to experience and value nature

This is **capital funding** – it can be used to buy ‘things’ but not pay for ongoing costs like salaries or general running costs.  You must show how you will maintain your project for at least 5 years after the end of this funding.
 
Some ideas for potential projects include planting street trees, orchards, wildflower meadows or creating community growing spaces and /or allotments in your area; creating green space on artificial structures and surfaces in urban areas; improving access to existing or new sites to maximise equitable access to all; changing mowing practices to benefit biodiversity; purchasing litter picking equipment; or putting up nest boxes and camera traps.

Applications are invited from Constituted Groups, Registered Charities, Companies, Private Business and Public Sector organisations providing services to benefit nature and communities in Ceredigion.
 
We welcome bids for small projects worth up to £5,000 or larger projects of up to £50,000. Please note that all grants will be paid in arrears on receipt of evidence of expenditure; payment by instalment can be arranged.  If you wish to discuss this, please get in touch.
Expressions of interest welcomed at this stage.  Closing date to be confirmed.

For an application form or more details, please email your project outline or any queries to <biodiversity@ceredigion.gov.uk>
