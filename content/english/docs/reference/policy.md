## Section 6 of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016:
Section 6 covers Biodiversity and Resilience of Ecosystems and how local authorities must aim to integrate its protection. The duty requires that local authorities must seek to maintain and enhance biodiversity in the exercise of their functions in relation to Wales, and in doing so promote the resilience of ecosystems into their early thinking and business planning, including any policies, plans, programmes and projects. Actions to help biodiversity only need to be proportionate to the public authority’s activities and functions.  
## Planning (Wales) Act 2015
This act modernizes the Welsh planning system to promote sustainable development, focusing on a plan-led approach. Key elements include introducing a national framework (Future Wales), enabling regional Strategic Development Plans (SDPs), reforming development management, and introducing mandatory pre-application consultation. Some provisions include strengthening the plan-led approach to planning by introducing a new legal framework for the Welsh Ministers to prepare a national land use plan, improvement to enforcement and appeal procedures. It also requires planning applications for nationally significant projects to be made to the Welsh Ministers.  
## Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015: 
The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act is about improving the social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales. The Act gives a legally binding common purpose for national governments, local authorities and other public bodies. It details the ways in which specified public bodies must work and work together to improve the well-being of Wales. Sets out seven well-being goals for authorities to achieve.  
## Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981: 
This act is a primary legislation for nature conservation, which protect wild birds, animals and plants as well as protected areas that are listed under the Sites of special Scientific Interest. It applies in England, Wales and Scotland. This act states that it is illegal to injure or kill any wild animals or their offspring or destroy their habitats.  
## Natural Resources Policy
The Natural Resources Policy sets out a framework for the sustainable management of natural resources to enhance ecosystem resilience and provide long-term benefits for the environment, economy, and society. It prioritizes nature-based solutions, resource efficiency, and renewable energy to address climate change and biodiversity decline. Some of the core principles involve, delivering nature-based solutions, increasing resource efficiency and promoting renewable energy.  
## Welsh Government Nature Recovery Action Plan (Wales) 2020
Since the Nature Recovery Action Plan 2015, it has been improved to consider the growing evidence around the scale of the loss of biodiversity and the changing policy context in Wales. This 2020 plan identifies the urgency of recognizing and valuing biodiversity in our accounting and decision-making across sectors and portfolios and demonstrating that value through support for skills and capacity and governance. The actions address the need to improve our evidence and monitoring for the long term, and to understand the role that nature plays in our lives and well-being.  
## Independent Water Commission Final Report: 
Last updated in July 2025, the Independent Water Commission Report proposed a major “reset” of the England and Wales water sector, outlining 88 recommendations to fix failing, siloed regulation and underinvestment.  
## Sustainable Farming Scheme 2026
This scheme has been designed to support farmers in the ongoing sustainable production of food, at the same time as addressing the climate and nature emergency. This is crucial to protect our future food producing capacity. This will support farmers to improve productivity which will put them in a stronger position to face increasing consumer demands.
