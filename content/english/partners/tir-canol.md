### What is Tir Canol?
A community that’s designing and providing positive outcomes for nature and people through our use of the land and sea.

### Where is Tir Canol?
We use the rivers Dyfi in the north and Rheidol in the south as our imagined, natural boundaries. As Tir Canol develops further, and people lead on particular areas of interest this will reflect on the geographic area of focus for this project. 

### Why?
We’re facing a huge reduction in biodiversity and major ecological and climate problems at local, national, and international levels. Tir Canol seeks to develop ideas for how we as a community can collaboratively improve our area for people and nature.
