We work across Wales to give wildlife a home. RSPB Cymru manages 18 reserves across the country, ranging from offshore islands to mountain tops, from wetlands to woodlands. We’re safeguarding diverse habitats for the species that live in them, so wild spaces and wild creatures are around for generations to come.  

In a country where Choughs swoop above steep cliffs, Red Kites soar over rugged hillsides and Grey Seals laze along the coast, it can be hard to believe that nature is in trouble. But it is. Wales is now one of the most nature depleted countries in the world, with populations of wild birds, mammals, amphibians, insects and invertebrates under serious pressure. That’s why our efforts matter more than ever.
