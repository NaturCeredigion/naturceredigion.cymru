Since 1997, the CAVO Team have promoted and supported volunteers and voluntary community action in Ceredigion – from finding volunteers their perfect role to giving grants for community projects, the CAVO Team are here to help.

As Ceredigion’s County Voluntary Council and a Third Sector Support Wales partner, CAVO work across the following four key pillars of activity in supporting the third sector and volunteers, and in our work with key statutory partners;

* Volunteering
* Good Governance
* Sustainable Funding
* Engagement and Influence

We can support you to develop your group and projects and help you recruit new volunteers.  We’ll also keep you informed of what’s happening in Ceredigion and beyond!

Support us by sharing your successes and challenges so we can best represent the sector and champion what you’re achieving.
