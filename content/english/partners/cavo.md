The CAVO Team champions volunteering and community action across Ceredigion, supporting everything from helping individuals find the right volunteering opportunity to providing grants that bring local projects to life. 

As Ceredigion’s County Voluntary Council and a Third Sector Support Wales partner, CAVO works across four key pillars that strengthen the third sector and its collaboration with statutory partners:
- Volunteering
- Good Governance
- Sustainable Funding
- Engagement and Influence

CAVO supports groups to develop their work, grow their projects, recruit new volunteers and keeps the sector informed about developments in Ceredigion and beyond.
