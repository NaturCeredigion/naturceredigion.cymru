## Principles of Dyfi Biosphere
1. People – their attitudes and activities – are central to the Biosphere process.
2. The Dyfi Biosphere is a place where people’s feeling of well being is enhanced, where people are empowered and involved in deliberation, decision-making and co-delivery.
3. The role of government and statutory organizations is to facilitate sustainable development and to encourage and enable people to take responsibility.
4. The Dyfi Biosphere is an exemplary area, setting the benchmark for “green”, bilingual living.
5. Our economy is becoming more self reliant and less carbon intensive, based largely on local culture, resources, products and environmental assets.
6. Constructive change occurs, but almost incidentally as a result of protecting, strengthening and celebrating elements of life and the world which the community values and wants to pass on to future generations.
