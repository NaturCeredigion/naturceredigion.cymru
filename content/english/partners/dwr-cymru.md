Biodiversity and our wider ecosystem services face threats including habitat loss, fragmentation and over-exploitation. In the longer term, temperature and changed rainfall patterns will also impact biodiversity.

We will look for ways to help nature, enhance biodiversity and promote ecosystem resilience, while we carry out our water and sewerage activities. Reliable drinking water sources are also dependent on healthy functioning ecosystems.

Welsh Water has a duty under the Environment (Wales) Act (2016) and in support of the Well-being of Future Generations Act to enhance biodiversity and promote the resilience of ecosystems in the exercise of our functions.

We are shifting our emphasis to proactive management of water in the wider environment rather than reactive treatment within our treatment works. By working closely with our partners and regulators, we aim to implement more nature-based solutions in our catchments. This includes activities such as management of habitats, or adapting farming practices to reduce or avoid risks to water quality, rather than building more steel & concrete structures.
