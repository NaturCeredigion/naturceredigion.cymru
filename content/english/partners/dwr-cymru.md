As an organisation owned on behalf of our customers, caring for nature isn’t just an obligation—it’s central to who we are. Our long-term responsibility to the communities we serve shapes every decision we make.
 
We will look for ways to help nature, enhance biodiversity and promote ecosystem resilience, while we carry out our water and sewerage activities. Reliable drinking water sources are also dependent on healthy functioning ecosystems.

Welsh Water has a duty under the Environment (Wales) Act (2016) and in support of the Well-being of Future Generations Act to enhance biodiversity and promote the resilience of ecosystems in the exercise of our functions.

Looking ahead, we are entering the biggest investment period in our history. Between now and 2030, £4 billion will be invested across our network—£2.5 billion of which will directly benefit the environment. This includes work to restore habitats, reduce pollution, improve resilience and support nature recovery across the communities we serve. By working closely with our partners and regulators, we aim to implement more nature-based solutions in our catchments
