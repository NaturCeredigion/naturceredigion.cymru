Sara, a passionate flower farmer and the heart behind The Flower Meadow. On my small, sustainable flower farm in West Wales, I grow a variety of seasonal flowers, from vibrant sunflowers to delicate dahlias, all nurtured by hand and with a love for the earth.

For me, flower farming is more than just growing beautiful blooms – it’s about connecting people to the natural world. Each season brings new colours, textures, and fragrances, and I feel so lucky to share that magic with my community.

When I’m not in the field, you’ll find me creating beautiful bouquets or soaking up the early morning sunshine with a cuppa with the donkeys. Let’s bring a little more beauty into the world, one flower at a time.
