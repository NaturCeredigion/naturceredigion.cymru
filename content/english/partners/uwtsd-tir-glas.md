UWTSD is offering an ambitious and bold vision for Lampeter and the vicinity. It is a long-term scheme that will stimulate economic, social and cultural activity in the area and inject new life and energy into the town. It is a collaborative venture that will see the University working closely with Ceredigion County Council, Coleg Ceredigion and Coleg Sir Gâr, Lampeter Town Council, the Mid Wales Partnership and both the Welsh and UK Governments.

Tir Glas will develop and maintain an eco-system that will support rural infrastructure and act as a catalyst for the promotion of a resilient culture with a clear focus on food and hospitality. Sustainability and resilience will be at the core of the entire scheme, with these themes permeating through all its various components.

The vision has three key components

1. Tir Glas Food Academy
2. Rural Enterprise
3. CWIC Welsh Timber & Building Performance Development Centre 

These components will all be interconnected providing a unique opportunity for the town and the University to work together strategically for the benefit and prosperity of the local economy for years to come.

However, the most significant development will be the Tir Glas Food Academy on the University’s campus. The aim is to apply for funds from the Mid Wales Growth Deal in order to establish a central hub for food education in the region, providing a strategic forum with partner organisations to assist in the direction an co-ordination of all aspects of food training across Mid and South West Wales.   

Rural Enterprise will have an important role to play in promoting and supporting small businesses in a rural context, with a specific focus on the food and hospitality industries. This will concentrate on providing support and training for those wishing to develop higher business skills and gain access to professional training.

By establishing The CWIC Welsh Timber and Building Performance Development Centre, the University aims to collaborate with Wood Knowledge Wales to bring together dedicated resources and research in order to promote modern and sustainable methods of construction with the aim of decarbonising the construction industry in Wales in due course.
