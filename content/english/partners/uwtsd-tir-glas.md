UWTSD is offering an ambitious and bold vision for Lampeter and the vicinity. It is a long-term scheme that will stimulate economic, social and cultural activity in the area and inject new life and energy into the town. It is a collaborative venture that will see the University working closely with Ceredigion County Council, Coleg Ceredigion and Coleg Sir GÃ¢r, Lampeter Town Council, the Mid Wales Partnership and both the Welsh and UK Governments.

Tir Glas will develop and maintain an eco-system that will support rural infrastructure and act as a catalyst for the promotion of a resilient culture with a clear focus on food and hospitality. Sustainability and resilience will be at the core of the entire scheme, with these themes permeating through all its various components.

The vision has three key components

1. Tir Glas Food Academy
2. Rural Enterprise
3. CWIC Welsh Timber & Building Performance Development Centre 

These components will all be interconnected providing a unique opportunity for the town and the University to work together strategically for the benefit and prosperity of the local economy for years to come.
