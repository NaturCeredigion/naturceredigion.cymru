The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales is one of 46 Wildlife Trusts across the UK. We cover an area of 9,787 km² in South and West Wales - including around half of Wales’ coastline! We own and manage 110 nature reserves covering 2,007 hectares, 50 of which are designated SSSIs, 10 are National Nature Reserves and 4 are islands, including [Skomer](https://www.welshwildlife.org/visit/skomer-island) and [Skokholm](https://www.welshwildlife.org/visit/skokholm-island) island. We have around 800 volunteers and over 10,000 members!

### What we do
Our mission is to rebuild biodiversity and engage people with their environment by:
* Publicly standing up for wildlife and the environment
