West Wales Biodiversity Information Centre (WWBIC) is one of the four Local Environmental Records Centres in Wales (LERCs), covering the counties of Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, and Carmarthenshire (excluding the Brecon Beacons National Park). 

The primary role of the company is to collect, collate, and disseminate biodiversity information for the region. Managing a growing database of more than 4 million species and a collection of habitat and protected sites information, we respond to data requests from our partners, including local authorities, government bodies and private consultants. We also run a variety of projects and work closely with the recording community.

The biological recording community is vitally important to the company, as sharing their records enables us to grow the database of species information which provides an essential evidence base for putting biodiversity at the heart of decision-making.

All four Local Environmental Records Centres in Wales work together as a consortium under the banner **[LERC Wales](https://www.lercwales.org.uk/)**.
