[Small Woods](https://www.smallwoods.org.uk/) is a national charity and company limited by guarantee, with woodland programmes in England, Wales and Scotland. Small Woods was formed in 1988 as the national organisation for small woodlands, it has a significant track record in managing Social Forestry projects, as well as projects to promote sustainable management of small woodlands for social, environmental and economic benefit.

Coed Lleol / Small Woods in Wales was established in 2002, and we have been running a huge range of outdoor and nature based health and wellbeing activities since 2010. Visit our [projects page](https://www.smallwoods.org.uk/en/coedlleol/what-we-do/projects/) for more information. We also established a support network for community woodland groups which now runs independently as [Llais Y Goedwig](http://www.llaisygoedwig.org.uk/).
