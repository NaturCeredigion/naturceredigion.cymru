Sara is a passionate flower farmer and the heart behind The Flower Meadow. On her small, sustainable flower farm in West Wales, she grows a variety of seasonal flowers, from vibrant sunflowers to delicate dahlias, all nurtured by hand and with a love for the earth.

For Sara, flower farming is more than just growing beautiful blooms – it’s about connecting people to the natural world. Each season brings new colours, textures, and fragrances, and she feels so lucky to share that magic with my community.

When she’s not in the field, you’ll find Sara creating beautiful bouquets or soaking up the early morning sunshine with a cuppa with the donkeys. Let’s bring a little more beauty into the world, one flower at a time.
