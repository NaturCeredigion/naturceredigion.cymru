The Ceredigion Local Nature Partnership (LNP) holds quarterly meetings that bring together members of the public, organisations and practitioners with a shared interest in nature.

Meetings provide a friendly and open space to discuss what’s happening locally and nationally, share ideas, and explore what more can be done to support nature across Ceredigion. Each year includes three hybrid meetings (in person with an online option) and one online-only meeting in January, making it easy for everyone to take part.
  
Agendas typically include:
- Updates from LNP members
- Updates from Ceredigion County Council
- Presentations and inspirational speakers from across Wales
- Opportunities for discussion and shared learning
  
From time to time, meetings may also include site visits to local nature areas, led by knowledgeable speakers who can share insights into habitats, species and practical nature recovery on the ground.

All meetings are free and open to everyone. Whether you are part of an organisation, a land manager, a volunteer or simply interested in nature, you are very welcome to join us.
