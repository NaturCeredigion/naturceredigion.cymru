Ceredigion Local Nature Partnership (CLNP) is a strategic collaboration of public agencies, local voluntary organisations, businesses, community groups and individuals working together to protect and radically enhance nature

From Rhos pastures and ancient woodland to its rich coastline, Ceredigion has an amazing diversity of landscapes and wildlife; but they are precious, fragile, and under threat from a variety of environmental pressures.

CLNP is part of the [Local Nature Partnership Cymru](https://lnp.cymru/) and hosted by [Ceredigion County Council](https://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/resident/coast-countryside/conservation-and-wildlife-new/).

At this time of climate and ecological emergency the Ceredigion Local Nature Partnership (LNP) aims to:
- Engage communities and raise awareness of the vital benefits that a healthy natural environment brings to people and the economy.
- Steer the collective work of individuals, conservationists and business to work in partnership to protect, improve, create and connect Ceredigion’s natural landscape.
- Collaborate with the Public Service Board and support other public bodies to protect and enhance nature across the county.
- Work to maintain, restore and create habitats that are thriving with wildlife including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, plants, fungi and more.
- Ensure Ceredigion’s marine, intertidal, terrestrial and freshwater environments retain and regain good health.
- Make sure consideration for the environment and incorporating nature recovery objectives are put right at the heart of local decision-making.
