Ceredigion is a special place. Walesâ€™ fourth largest county by land area, Ceredigion is home to many fascinating ecosystems.

The Nature Recovery Action Plan (NRAP) represents the first attempt to create a comprehensive yet accessible strategy for helping nature recovery in the county. Whilst previous documents and plans have been published, this NRAP seeks to represent a new vision for nature recovery, one that is open to all those in the county who wish to participate. It is only through a truly cross-society, collaborative approach that this NRAP can be implemented, and nature recovery achieved.
